# twitter-bot-
A Python bot that scrapes r/cats and Tweets the top posts and pictures. 

botSecurity.py and scraperSecurity.py are ignored owing to security reasons. 

botSecurity.py contains Twitter API access keys, and scraperSecurity.py contains the Reddit API and Bitly API access keys.
If you want to run this script, make your own versions of these files so the bot scripts in this branch can import them.
